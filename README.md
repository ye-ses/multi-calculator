# multi-calculator
This project uses react to build different calculators aimed at helping school children with basic calculations and how to solve them
it uses react hooks to continuously render changed states

The calculators present are the basic calculator, currency converter, the distance converter and speed, distance-time claculator.
Here's the link to the page https://ye-ses.github.io/multi-calculator/
